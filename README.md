# udacity-movie-website

This repository contains a simple movie trailers website written as an exercise in web development. Running the script `fresh_tomatoes.py` generates and opens an html file from the data in `movie_data.tsv` using the code in `media.py`. The module `media.py` contains a helpful named tuple `Movie` to structure the movie data, as well as a function to read the tsv data.

## Usage

Run `fresh_tomatoes.py` with Python. This code has been tested with Python versions 2.7.10 and 3.5.0., and there are no dependencies outside of the standard library.

    $ python fresh_tomatoes.py
